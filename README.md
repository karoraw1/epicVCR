1. map reads from these two libraries: SERC_517_6, SERC_517_12 to 9 cyanophage genomes
2. make coverage histogram using r_slithy script
3. make gene table where it shows average coverage and std coverage by gene for each genome

4. run nucmer between viral refseq & all contigs (~7% are unbinned)
5. look for matches between cyanophage genomes & contigs
6. compare that level of homology with other hits to find other signifincant matches
7. find which bin they are placed in the proporiton of the bin comprised by the matched contigs
